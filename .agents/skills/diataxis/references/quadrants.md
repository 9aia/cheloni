## Tutorial

### Core Definition

A tutorial is a **lesson** that takes the learner through a practical experience under the guidance of an instructor. The learner acquires skills and knowledge by doing, not by being told.

### Characteristics

- **Learning-oriented**: Designed to help the user acquire skills
- **Practical**: The user does things, not just reads about them
- **Safe**: The instructor is responsible for the learner's success
- **Sequential**: Steps follow a logical learning progression
- **Repeatable**: The learner can return and do it again

### What a Tutorial IS

- A guided learning experience
- Focused on what the learner does
- Designed around meaningful, achievable goals
- Concrete and specific, not abstract
- Results-oriented (visible outcomes at each step)

### What a Tutorial IS NOT

- A reference for looking things up
- A place for extensive explanation
- A showcase of all features
- A decision-making guide with options
- Documentation about what something is

### Defining Characteristics

Effective tutorials typically exhibit these patterns:

- **Goal visibility**: The learner knows from the start what they will achieve
- **Frequent results**: Each step produces a visible, meaningful outcome
- **Narrative of expected**: Phrases like "You'll see..." and "The output will show..."
- **Minimal explanation**: Context limited to one sentence; deeper explanation linked elsewhere
- **Concrete focus**: Specific actions on specific things, not abstract concepts
- **No branching**: A single path with no alternatives offered
- **High reliability**: The tutorial works consistently for every user

### Language Patterns

| Do Use | Avoid |
|--------|-------|
| "In this tutorial, we will..." | "In this tutorial, you will learn..." |
| "First, do X" | "First, you need to understand X" |
| "Now, do Y" | "You might want to consider Y" |
| "You'll notice that..." | "This is because..." |
| "We're using X because it's simpler" | "X works by..." [extended explanation] |

### Food Analogy

A tutorial is like **teaching a child to cook**. The goal is not to produce a perfect dish—it's to give the child confidence and skills. The child learns by doing alongside you. You don't explain the Maillard reaction; you say "see how it's turning brown? That means it's ready."

## How-to Guide

### Core Definition

A how-to guide provides **directions** to guide an already-competent user through a real-world problem or toward a specific goal. It's focused on work, not learning.

### Characteristics

- **Goal-oriented**: Addresses a specific real-world outcome
- **Practical**: Provides actionable steps
- **Assumes competence**: Reader knows the domain
- **Problem-focused**: Responds to "I need to do X"
- **Adaptable**: May include branches or conditions

### What a How-to IS

- Directions for achieving a specific goal
- Written for someone already at work
- Focused on the user's problem, not the tool
- Practical and immediately applicable
- Responsive to real-world complexity

### What a How-to IS NOT

- A lesson for beginners (that's a tutorial)
- A complete reference (that's reference)
- An explanation of concepts (that's explanation)
- A showcase of capabilities
- A teaching document

### Defining Characteristics

Effective how-to guides typically exhibit these patterns:

- **User-perspective framing**: Problems stated from the user's viewpoint, not the tool's
- **Assumed competence**: No explanation of basics; reader knows the domain
- **Goal focus**: All content serves achieving the stated outcome
- **Logical sequence**: Steps ordered by dependency or workflow
- **Conditional branching**: May include "if X, then Y" paths
- **Minimal scope**: No tangents; completeness is not a goal
- **Linked details**: Reference documentation for options, not inline lists

### Language Patterns

| Do Use | Avoid |
|--------|-------|
| "This guide shows you how to..." | "Let's learn how to..." |
| "To do X, do Y" | "Before we begin, let's understand..." |
| "If you want X, then..." | "First, you need to know that..." |
| "Refer to the reference for options" | [Complete list of all options inline] |

### Food Analogy

A how-to guide is like **a recipe in a cookbook**. The reader already knows how to cook—they're not learning to cook from this recipe. They want to make a specific dish. The recipe tells them what to do, not why they're doing it or what a sauté pan is.

---

## Reference

### Core Definition

Reference documentation provides **technical description** of the machinery. It is accurate, complete, and austere. Users consult it; they don't read it cover to cover.

### Characteristics

- **Information-oriented**: Provides facts about the system
- **Accurate**: Must be truthful and precise
- **Austere**: No narrative, no personality
- **Structured**: Mirrors the structure of what it describes
- **Complete**: Covers everything (within scope)

### What Reference IS

- Description of the machinery and how it operates
- Organized by the structure of the thing described
- Neutral and objective
- A source of truth for facts
- Consultable (look up what you need)

### What Reference IS NOT

- Instructions on how to do something (that's how-to)
- An explanation of why things are this way (that's explanation)
- A guide for beginners (that's tutorial)
- Opinionated or advisory
- Narrative or discursive

### Defining Characteristics

Effective reference documentation typically exhibits these patterns:

- **Description over instruction**: States what something is, not what to do with it
- **Neutral tone**: No opinions, recommendations, or preferences expressed
- **Structural mirroring**: Organization reflects the structure of the thing described
- **Completeness within scope**: Everything in scope is documented
- **Accuracy as priority**: Serves as the source of truth for facts
- **Illustrative examples**: Examples demonstrate usage without instructing
- **Consistent format**: Follows standard, predictable patterns

### Language Patterns

| Do Use | Avoid |
|--------|-------|
| "X is..." | "You should use X when..." |
| "The options are: A, B, C" | "I recommend using A because..." |
| "Returns: Y" | "This will give you Y, which you can then..." |
| "Parameters: name (string)" | "First, pass the name parameter..." |

### Food Analogy

Reference is like **the information on the back of a food package**: nutritional facts, ingredients, storage instructions, allergen warnings. It's factual, structured, and complete. You don't read it for enjoyment—you consult it when you need specific information.

## Explanation

### Core Definition

Explanation provides **discursive discussion** that helps the reader understand. It offers context, background, reasoning, and connections. It answers "why?"

### Characteristics

- **Understanding-oriented**: Helps the reader comprehend
- **Discursive**: Discusses, explores, circles around topics
- **Contextual**: Provides background and connections
- **Reflective**: For study, away from work
- **Permissive of opinion**: Can include perspective

### What Explanation IS

- Discussion that illuminates a topic
- Background and context for understanding
- Answers to "why is it this way?"
- Connections to other ideas and systems
- Perspective on alternatives and trade-offs

### What Explanation IS NOT

- Steps to follow (that's tutorial or how-to)
- Facts to look up (that's reference)
- Instructions for doing something
- A teaching lesson
- Strictly objective (opinion is allowed)

### Defining Characteristics

Effective explanation documentation typically exhibits these patterns:

- **Connected ideas**: Links concepts, compares systems, shows relationships
- **Rich context**: Includes history, design decisions, constraints
- **"Why" orientation**: Focuses on reasoning behind choices
- **Permitted opinion**: Perspective and judgment are present and appropriate
- **Discursive prose**: No procedures or commands
- **Bounded scope**: Clear limits prevent absorption of other content
- **Multiple angles**: Approaches the topic from different perspectives

### Language Patterns

| Do Use | Avoid |
|--------|-------|
| "The reason for X is..." | "To do X, first..." |
| "This is because..." | "Step 1: ..." |
| "Consider that..." | "Run the following command..." |
| "An alternative approach would be..." | "The function returns..." |
| "Historically, this arose from..." | "In this tutorial, we'll..." |

### Food Analogy

Explanation is like **an article on culinary social history**: why we eat what we eat, how cuisines developed, the reasons behind food customs. You'd read it away from the kitchen, perhaps with a cup of tea. It deepens your understanding of food without telling you how to cook anything.

## Quadrant Boundaries

### Tutorial ↔ How-to (Action axis)

Both inform action, but:
- **Tutorial**: User is learning (acquisition), instructor is responsible
- **How-to**: User is working (application), user is responsible

**Test**: Is the reader at study or at work?

### Reference ↔ Explanation (Cognition axis)

Both inform cognition, but:
- **Reference**: User is working, needs facts to apply
- **Explanation**: User is studying, wants to understand

**Test**: Is the reader consulting for work or reading to understand?

### Tutorial ↔ Explanation (Acquisition axis)

Both serve acquisition, but:
- **Tutorial**: User learns by doing (action)
- **Explanation**: User learns by understanding (cognition)

**Test**: Is the reader doing or thinking?

### How-to ↔ Reference (Application axis)

Both serve application, but:
- **How-to**: User needs to do something (action)
- **Reference**: User needs to know something (cognition)

**Test**: Does the reader need steps or facts?
