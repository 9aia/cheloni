# Core API Reference

The core API is organized into four layers: Definition, Creation, Execution, and Manifest.

- [Definition API Reference](./definition.md) - Define CLI structure with plain objects and Zod schemas
- [Creation API Reference](./creation.md) - Create runtime instances from definitions
- [Execution API Reference](./execution.md) - Execute commands and handle the command pipeline
- [Manifest API Reference](./manifest.md) - Extract serializable metadata for introspection
